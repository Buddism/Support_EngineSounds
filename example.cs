//  currentGear 0:
//  currentGearSpeed = 0
//  nextGearSpeed    = 7
//  progressIntoNextGear = currentVelocity - currentGearSpeed) / (nextGearSpeed - currentGearSpeed);

//  scaled_pitch: ( ES_GearPitchStart[currentGear] shifted to ES_GearPitchPeak[currentGear] ) by progressIntoNextGear

//   if( actual_pitch IS_LESS_THAN   0.001     ) THEN actual_pitch = 0.001;


//  =====EXAMPLE=====
//   in use at 3.5 TU /sec in gear 0
//  currentGear 0:
//  currentGearSpeed = 0
//  nextGearSpeed    = 7

//  currentVelocity  = 3.5
//  progressIntoNextGear = currentVelocity - currentGearSpeed) / (nextGearSpeed - currentGearSpeed);
//  progressIntoNextGear = currentVelocity[3.5] - currentGearSpeed[0.0]) / (nextGearSpeed[7.0] - currentGearSpeed[0.0]);
//  progressIntoNextGear = (3.5 - 0.0) / (7.0 - 0.0) = 0.5
//  progressIntoNextGear = 0.5

//  scaled_pitch: ( ES_GearPitchStart[currentGear] shifted to ES_GearPitchPeak[currentGear] ) by progressIntoNextGear
//  using ES_GearPitchStart[0] shifted to ES_GearPitchPeak[1.5] by progressIntoNextGear[0.5]

//  ====THE END PITCH====
//   real pitch at 3.5 TU /sec [7 BPS] = ES_StartPitch + 0.75 = 1.75
